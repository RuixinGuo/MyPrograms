These cpp programs I write are the solutions of Data Structure section of Preliminary Examination.

The cpp files is named in the (year|semester|question) formart. For example, the file named 2019s1.cpp means this program is the solution of Question 1 of the 2019 Spring examination.

The main function in each program is used for testing the class. I think it is OK if you do not write the main function in examination. Just writing the class is OK.
