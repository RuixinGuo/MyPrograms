These cpp programs I write are the solutions of Data Structure section of Preliminary Examination.

The cpp files are named in the (year|semester|question) formart. For example, the file named 2019s1.cpp means this program is the solution of Question 1 of the 2019 Spring examination.

The main function in each program is used for testing the class. I think main function is not necessary to write in examination. Just writing the class is OK.
